# Introduction

## About

SpectMorph is a free software project which allows to analyze samples of
musical instruments, and to combine them (morphing). It can be used to
construct hybrid sounds, for instance a sound between a trumpet and a flute; or
smooth transitions, for instance a sound that starts as a trumpet and then
gradually changes to a flute.

In its current version, SpectMorph ships with many ready-to-use instruments
which can be combined using morphing. There is also an [Instrument
Editor](#instrument-editor) which allows you to build your own instruments
and create new sounds by morphing.

SpectMorph can be used as a CLAP/VST/LV2 plugin which can be loaded by many
sequencers. It runs on pretty much every operating system:

 * Linux (CLAP/VST/LV2/JACK)
 * macOS (CLAP/VST/LV2), Apple Silicon and x86_64
 * Windows (CLAP/VST/LV2), 64-bit

SpectMorph is implemented in C++ and licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1 or
later.

# User Interface

## Main Window

At the left side, there is a list of operators that generate the sound.  New
operators can be added using the "Add Operator" menu.

Each operator has a name, which must be unique. To change the name of an
operator, double-click on the title. Operators can be folded with the triangle
button at the left upper corner, to save screen space. The x at the upper right
side deletes the operator.

Operators can be moved upwards and downwards by clicking on the title and
dragging the operator. The color of the title indicates the status of the
operator:

* green: this operator is selected as output
* white: the operator is part of the output sound
* grey: the operator is not used (not part of the output sound)

The output operator at the right side contains global settings which control
how the sound output is performed. There is always one output operator.

# Operators

## Source

The **Source** operator generates the sound of one standard instrument, like
_Trumpet_ or _Pan Flute_. Earlier versions of SpectMorph required using source
operators fairly often: to morph a _Trumpet_ and a _Pan Flute_, one source was
necessary for the _Trumpet_, one for the _Pan Flute_ and both sources
were connected to one **Linear Morph**.

However, in recent versions of SpectMorph, **Linear Morph** and **Grid Morph**
can be used to morph standard instruments directly. So **Source** can be
avoided in many cases.

## WavSource

The **WavSource** operator generates the sound for a user defined instrument.
It is called _WavSource_ because users often want to morph an audio file, for
instance `example.wav` with something else. In order to use samples in the
**WavSource** operator, some editing is required to provide informations
necessary for morphing.

User defined instruments are stored into one of 128 possible slots and
can be created/edited using the [Instrument Editor](#instrument-editor).

## Linear Morph

The **Linear Morph** operator produces morphing between two sources.

Source A

: Set the first source used for morphing. This can be any standard instrument,
or another operator. A **WavSource** can be used for morphing with a user
defined instrument, or **Linear Morph** can be used for morphing with the
output of another linear morph.

Source B

: Set the second source used for morphing.

Control Input

: Specify how to control the morphing, can be **Gui Slider** for doing it
manually, external **Control Signal #1/#2** or another source (typically
[LFO](#lfo)).

dB Linear Morphing

: Select method of the morphing of the amplitude of the parials works. If
selected, the amplitudes are converted to dB, morphed and converted back,
otherwise the amplitudes are morphed with a linear method. This doesn't make
much of a difference for many samples, but for some, enabling or disabling this
produces a better result.

## Grid Morph

The **Grid Morph** operator allows morphing instruments that are arranged on a
plane.  For instance a **2 x 2** grid can morph four instruments which are
placed on the corners of a square.

Width

: Set the width of the grid

Height

: Set the height of the grid

X/Y Control

: Specify how to control the morphing, can be **Gui Slider** for doing it
manually, external **Control Signal #1/#2** or another source (typically
[LFO](#lfo)).

The instruments in the grid can be edited by clicking on one of the grid
nodes. This will select the node, and the following options can be set
for the node:

Source

: The source for this grid node. It can be any standard instrument or
another operator.

Volume

: The relative volume of the grid node.

## LFO

The **LFO** operator (low frequency oscillator) provides a control signal
which slowly changes. It can for instance be used to control the morphing
of other operators.

The **LFO** parameters that control the wave type, frequency and so on are

* Wave Type
* Frequency
* Depth
* Center
* Start Phase

Normally, the **LFO** operator is computed for each voice separately, which
means that each voice has its own phase. If the **Sync Phase for all voices**
is selected, all voices share the same phase (i.e. all voices go up and down at
the same time).

## Output

The **Output** operator controls how the sound generated from the sources at
the left side is post processed and played. The **Source** property selects
which operator is played. The user interface displays the selected operator
title in green.

The **Velocity Sns** property specifies how much the note velocity of the
midi input affects the volume SpectMorph uses for playback.

The output sound is composed of a _sine_ and a _noise part_. **Enable
Noise/Sine Synthesis** can be used to disable or enable them seperately.

### Unison

The unison effect makes the sound more fat by adding up multiple detuned
versions of the sound. The parameters **Voices/Detune** can be used to
configure the effect.

### ADSR

Normally SpectMorph tries to reproduce the volume envelope of an instrument
as it was in the original sample. By using the ADSR envelope, you can change
the shape of the volume envelope. The Parameters for the shape of the
envelope are

* Attack
* Decay
* Sustain
* Release

Since your desired attack may be sharper than the original instrument attack,
the ADSR envelope skips a part of the original instrument. This is controlled
using the **Skip** parameter. So if the ADSR is enabled, we play somewhere
from the middle of the input, in order to be able to produce a sharp attack.

<!-- FIXME: this probably could be done more elegantly -->

### Portamento

In portamento/mono mode, SpectMorph only has one single voice. Each time notes
overlap, the pitch will glide from the old note to the new note. The speed
can be controlled by the **Glide** parameter.

### Vibrato

This effect adds vibrato, controlled by the **Depth** and **Frequency**
parameters. If **Attack** is set, the vibrato builds up slowly during
the selected time.

# Instrument Editor

## Overview

The instrument editor can be started from a [WavSource](#wav-source) operator
by pressing the **Edit** button.

## User Instrument Storage

In order to store user defined instruments, SpectMorph has a global list of 128
instruments. Each slot can contain one user defined instrument.

The instrument number can be set from the WavSource operator. It is important
that you use an empty position for each new instrument.  Suppose you assigned
number 7 for an intrument based on a vocal sample.  Whenever you use
SpectMorph, slot number 7 will contain this instrument. As long as you are
experimenting with a new instrument, you can change it in any way you like.
However, as soon as you start using the instrument in a song, you should never
change it again.

## Samples

An instrument is created based on one or more samples. For simple use cases,
one sample is enough. However, if you play a sample with much higher frequency
or lower frequency than the original recording, it will no longer sound
natural.

If this happens, you need to add more samples. For some instruments, two
samples per octave could be enough, for others, you need 3 or 4 samples per
octave to get a good quality. Many standard instruments that ship with
SpectMorph even use 12 samples per octave. During playback, SpectMorph will
pick the closest sample to the midi note it needs to play.

SpectMorph will analyze each sample you load, and build a model of the sound.
This model is used to reproduce your sound, and to perform morphing. The model
consists of the frequencies/amplitudes of the partials of the sound (modelled
as sine waves) and noise for each frame. You can expect good quality from the
morphing only if this model is good.

Not all samples work well as input. In all cases, samples should contain one
single note. To test if a sample works well, play "Original Sample" and then
"SpectMorph Instrument" in the instrument editor.  If these sound approximately
the same, then this sample should work.  Note that you need to set the correct
midi note (pitch) first, before you compare "Original Sample" and "SpectMorph
Instrument", as the quality of the model also depends on the midi note.

Looking at a spectrogram of your input sound can also be helpful. If the
partial structure looks very regular, then you probably have a sample that
works well with SpectMorph.

Finally, all the standard instruments obviously work well. So if your sample
sounds somewhat similar to one of the existing instruments, it should work
well. Acoustic musical instruments like strings, brass or human voice usually
have the regular partial structure SpectMorph needs.

## Loop Modes

For each sample, you need to define a loop. The loop markers are blue and have
click/drag handles at the top of the window. Since your sample ends after some
time, a loop is required to handle notes that are longer than this time.

### Single Frame

A single frame loop will freeze the sound once it enters the loop. It does this
by playing the same analysis frame again and again. This is good for sounds
that don't change over time, like for instance organ sounds.

For sounds that change over time, like sounds with vibrato/tremolo, this loop
mode is not useful.

### Forward

A forward loop will play from left to right loop marker and then jump back to
left. Since the forward loop jumps back, this will only sound good if the
sample sounds very similar at the left and right loop point.

Note that to define a loop, you don‘t have to find the exactly right time
points. The SpectMorph analysis/synthesis method only needs loop points that
are approximately correct. This is different from samplers, that replay the
sample data directly, where the loop points must be at the exactly perfect
position to avoid clicks.

### Ping Pong

A ping pong loop will play from left to right loop marker, then reverse play
back to left, play to right, back to left...

The advantage of a ping pong loop is that there are no jumps, which means that
no matter how the sample sounds at the left/right marker, it will always sound
good.

As an example how to use ping pong loops: if you have recorded some instrument
with vibrato, you select half a period of the vibrato:

* set the left loop marker the point where the vibrato is down
* set the right loop marker to the next point where the vibrato is up

## Midi Note (Pitch)

For each sample, you need to assign the correct pitch. SpectMorph needs to know
which pitch your sample has to transpose it correctly up and down during
synthesis. If you click on "Edit" next to "Midi Note", a dialog will show up.
This dialog has been designed to find the correct midi note in case you don't
know it already.

Using "Space" you can toggle playback of the selected sample. If you left click
on one of the notes, you can hear the pitch of a reference instrument. By
trying to click on some of the notes while your selected sample is played you
can find the correct pitch. Once you are certain what the pitch should be,
double-click and close the dialog.

## Volume Normalization

Usually, we want that all samples that a user instruments contains are played
at the same volume. Which means that we want that all notes of a user
instrument are equally loud. Volume normalization should be used to ensure
this. Since we usually want to morph with existing standard instruments, the
volume normalization should also make the user defined instrument as loud as
the existing instruments.

### From Loop

The typical volume normalization - which almost always works - computes the
volume in the loop region, and normalizes the sounds based on this volume (we
use energy to determine the volume, not peaks). So usually you check this and
then the samples will be normalized properly.

### Global

There are some rare cases where the automatic volume normalization doesn't work
well. In this case, it may be desirable to keep the relative volume of the
samples exactly as they were. To still be able to adjust the replay volume to
the same level as the standard instruments, global normalization can adjust all
samples using some dB global dB level.

This should only be used if "From Loop" did not produce a good result.

## Tuning

From the midi note, SpectMorph computes the frequency a recorded note has.  So
if you select a midi note "69 : A3", this frequency would be 440 Hz.  The auto
tuning methods described here are ways to deal with samples that have a
slightly different frequency than the theoretic value. As an example, if we
recorded a vocal at 450 Hz, the job of auto tuning is to correct it downwards.

Note that auto tuning only works for a narrow range around the selected note,
so in our example, you can't take a recording of 600 Hz and expect auto tune to
do the job.

### Partials

SpectMorph uses the first few partials (1..3) to estimate the frequency from
the analysis data. So all algorithms below allow you to specify how many
partials are used to compute the fundamental frequency. For many samples, this
doesn't make a big difference, and 3 is a good value; however, there are a few
cases where a lower value is a better choice, you can find this by trial and
error.

### Display Tuning

If you work with auto tuning, it is helpful to display the tuning over time as
estimated by SpectMorph. If you enable this option, the tuning will be drawn as
white line over the sample. It is possible to specify a number of cents for the
tuning range. For instance the default value of 100 Cent means that if the
tuning line is at the top of the sample view, the sample is 1 semitone above
the midi note, in the center that it is exactly the midi note, and at the
bottom it is 1 semitone below the midi note.

### Simple

Simple auto tuning is sufficient for cases where the whole sample is too high
or too low. The auto tuning algorithm will adjust the frequency so that the
sample will be correct on average. This doesn't work well if some parts of the
sample are too low and others are too high.

### All Frames

This algorithm will correct each frame individually, and make the tuning
effectively flat. This should work well if some parts of the sample are too low
and some parts of the sample are too high. However, the approach may make the
sound liveless, because it removes natural inexactness from the sample.

### Smooth

Original developed for vocal recordings, this is somewhat similar to the all
frames tuning. However, instead of forcing all frames to the exact pitch
required, it tries to preserve some of the inexactness. As an example, a
vibrato sound would not be completely flat, but the degree of vibrato would be
reduced, and as a result, the sample would be more close to the desired midi
note on average.

The "Amount" parameter specifies how much of the original tuning curve should
be preserved, the "Time" parameter specifies a duration for estimating the
average tuning.

## Custom Analysis Parameters

It is possible to pass custom analysis parameters to the analysis process.
This is an "expert only" feature, which is to say, if you don't know what this
does, usually there is no problem. Analysis parameters take the

    key=value

form, and although there are some possibilities here, there is only one worth
mentioning.

The `min-frame-size` parameter can be used to set the shortest possible
analysis frame. In general, analysis frames need to be longer if the sound has
a low midi note, and shorter if the sound has a high midi note. Normally
SpectMorph uses 40ms frames as shortest possible value. In some cases setting

    min-frame-size=10

produces better results for higher midi notes, possibly at the expense of
larger data files.
